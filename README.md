# Loading Tensorflow graph with C++ api (CMake)

This is a sample code showing how to load tensor graph using the c++ api. The script is written with CMake and thus allow cross platform implementation.

To compile tensorflow api library, please follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/jackyko1991/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/README.md)
